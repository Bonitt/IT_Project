To run the program it is recommended to use PyCharm Community Edition 2022.3.2. 
Any missing dependencies that are marked when opening the program can be installed
by hovering over the missing dependencies that have a red underline and press install dependency.

Do not run the program more than 2 - 3 times in a row as the website will block access to getting
the information required.

If the website does end up blocking you, waiting a couple of minutes (roughly 15) will allow you
to go again but for the same required amount of times mentioned above.
