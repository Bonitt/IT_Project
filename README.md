To run the program it is recommended to use PyCharm Community Edition 2022.3.2. 
Any missing dependencies that are marked when opening the program can be installed
by hovering over the missing dependencies that have a red underline and press install dependency.

Do not run the program more than 2 - 3 times in a row as the website will block access to getting
the information required.
